<h1>Malware Self Deletion Using Process Injection</h1>

<p>Saw a video titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcJdlzKS_5o&t=3314s">Self Deleting Malware</a> from a guy called Crow.
Very interesting way of achieving file deletion, thought I could do it differently using this method.</p>


<p>With the above code once the pipe has been created it will wait for a message to be sent, only one message can be sent to this pipe
as as soon as the pipe handler receives a message it assumes that is the path of the file to be deleted.
To alter, create pipe communication handler. Could also achieve this using child processes and anon pipes , however I just prefer this way.</p>
